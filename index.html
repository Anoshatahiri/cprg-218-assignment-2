            <p> Nihilism is that one person who will zone out during superficial rants about short-term stuff but gives the most, brutally, relevant advice. If you lose them at your friends party, try checking the designated smoking area. Their wardrobe mostly consists of black, perfect for an underground rave in Berlin or something, and they won’t wait for you to get out of the car to play the same divorced-dad-rock that feels ironically fitting. Goodluck intitating some small talk, they will reject it but debate free will at 2 am, leaving you pondering for the next 2.5 months.   </p>

        <h2> Existentialism </h2>
        <div id="second" class="content-section">
            <img id="art" src="art.png" alt="">
            <p> Existentialism is that one person who, after you just saw them just last week, posts a picture of themselves wandering a random forest in some foreign country. They will question your motives are after a five-hour party but won’t hesitate to clock in their upcoming 9am shift. Any niche artist you think you have discovered, they already knew and probably saw live. They embrace their spontaneity, constantly chasing experiences that bring meaning.  </p>

    <section id="Determinism" class="invisible">
        <h2> Determinism </h2>
        <div id="third" class="content-section">
            <img id="puzzle" src="puzzle.png" alt="">
            <p> Determinism is that one person who will leave the party early to execute their 20-step skin care routine before they head to bed. They will remind you about your ignored responsibilities but then make you the best spaghetti you have ever had in your life. It could probably beat grandmas. They value structure, even asking you to join them on their night quest in the local store to find the perfect candle for the upcoming week. It will be beige-coloured of course. Nonetheless, their steadiness is comforting, bringing a sense of order to the chaos of life.</p>

    <section id="Idealism" class="invisible">
        <h2> Idealism </h2>
        <div id="fourth" class="content-section">
            <img id="headphones" src="headphones.png" alt="">
            <p> Idealism is that one person who volunteers for some random community event and always seems focused on something beyond the mundane, beyond the third dimension. They’ll join you at that rave you’ve been excited for but spend their weekdays working some wholesome job, like working with children. Their thoughts often drift to something abstract. Please do not try talking to them if they haven’t had their daily debrief, or three-hour reflection. Regardless, they carry an optimistic outlook on life, believing in possibilities you haven’t even considered. </p>
